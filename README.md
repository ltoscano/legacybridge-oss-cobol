# 🐍 LegacyBridge OSS COBOL Migration Agents

**AI-powered COBOL to Java (Quarkus) migration framework built on Python using [`Atomic Agents`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) and [`Instructor`](https://github.com/567-labs/instructor) for seamless orchestration, structured validation, and automatic cost tracking.**

> **What is Quarkus?** Quarkus is a modern, cloud-native Java framework optimized for Kubernetes and serverless environments. It delivers ultra-fast startup times, low memory footprint, and native compilation capabilities, making it ideal for microservices and enterprise applications. Our migration generates production-ready Quarkus code with proper annotations, dependency injection, and RESTful service structures.

## 🧭 About this Project

This repository is a **modern Python rewrite** of the original Microsoft project [Legacy Modernization Agents (C#)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents), which provided an AI-assisted approach to COBOL-to-Java migration using [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

The Python implementation leverages the Atomic Agents framework to provide a more modular, schema-driven approach to AI agent management while maintaining all the functionality of the original C# system.

**What's new in this version:**
- Built on [`Atomic Agents`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) for standardized AI orchestration
- Uses [`Instructor`](https://github.com/567-labs/instructor) for structured LLM interactions with automatic validation
- **Automatic token and cost tracking** through instructor hooks
- **Docker-first** deployment with simplified setup
- **Enhanced observability** with comprehensive logging and conversation tracking

### About the Original Microsoft Project

The original [Legacy Modernization Agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents) represents a pioneering Microsoft initiative that emerged from a strategic collaboration with Denmark's [Bankdata](https://www.bankdata.dk/). This groundbreaking project demonstrates how AI agents can revolutionize legacy COBOL modernization at enterprise scale.

#### Technical Foundation

Built on Microsoft's **Semantic Kernel framework** with .NET 8.0, the system leverages **Process Functions** to orchestrate three specialized AI agents: CobolAnalyzer, JavaConverter, and DependencyMapper. The architecture is specifically optimized for **GPT-4.1 models** running at enterprise capacity (1M tokens/minute) and integrates seamlessly with **Azure OpenAI services**. Development is streamlined through Visual Studio Code Dev Containers, ensuring consistent environments across teams.

#### Enterprise-Grade Design

The project's **multi-agent architecture** embodies a clear separation of concerns, with each agent specializing in distinct phases of the migration pipeline. Configuration management follows enterprise patterns with a **dual-file system** (template + local credentials), while the included **`doctor.sh` CLI tool** provides comprehensive setup, validation, and migration management capabilities. This design philosophy prioritizes **observability, reliability, and scalability** for large-scale modernization initiatives.

#### Industry Impact & Proven Results

As a **joint research initiative** between Microsoft's Global Black Belt team and Bankdata, this project has garnered significant industry attention through featured blog posts and conference presentations. The **open-source release** was strategically designed to engage the broader COBOL community, gathering real-world code samples to further refine the AI models. 

With **enterprise-validated results**, the system has demonstrated remarkable efficiency: processing **102 COBOL files into 99 Java files** in just **~1.2 hours** at **sub-dollar costs**, achieving an impressive **97% successful conversion rate**. This proves the practical viability of AI-assisted legacy modernization at enterprise scale.

## 🧩 Why Rewrite It?

While the original C# project offered a strong foundation, this Python version introduces key innovations that dramatically improve **developer experience**, **observability**, **AI reliability**, and **deployment simplicity**:

| Benefit | Python Edition | C# Edition |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| AI Orchestration | `Atomic Agents` framework | Semantic Kernel framework |
| LLM Integration | ✅ Instructor + optimized prompts | ⚠️ Manual prompt engineering |
| Token Tracking | ✅ Instructor hooks | ✅ EnhancedLogger + ChatLogger |
| Schema Validation | ✅ Pydantic + retries | ⚠️ Manual response parsing |
| Provider Support | ✅ Multi-provider via Instructor | ⚠️ Azure OpenAI focused |
| Containerization | ✅ Docker-first | ✅ Dev Container + Docker |
| Logging | ✅ Advanced w/ conversation logs | ✅ Advanced w/ structured logs |
| Extensibility | ✅ Plugin-like agents | ⚠️ Hardcoded C# classes |

### Enhanced LLM Integration & Reliability

This Python rewrite leverages **[Instructor](https://github.com/567-labs/instructor)** library for superior LLM interactions:

- **Optimized Prompts**: All agent prompts have been refined for better accuracy and consistency
- **Structured Communication**: Instructor enforces strict input/output schemas via Pydantic, reducing AI errors
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic with validation ensures robust responses
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Easy switching between OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers
- **Performance**: Structured responses eliminate manual parsing, improving speed and reliability

### Atomic Agents Framework Advantages

Built on **[Atomic Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents)**, which offers significant improvements over frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI through its **IPO model** (Input-Process-Output) with Pydantic validation, **atomic components** with single responsibilities, and **transparent operations** without hidden abstractions.

This approach delivers a faster, more resilient, and scalable modernization pipeline with full developer control.

### Key Technical Improvements

1. **Schema-Driven Architecture**: Pydantic models ensure strong typing and validation across all data flows
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Full async/await support for improved performance and scalability
3. **Enhanced CLI Experience**: Rich interface with progress bars, styling, and interactive feedback
4. **Service-Oriented Design**: Clear separation of concerns with modular, testable components
5. **Automated Observability**: Built-in hooks capture token usage, costs, and conversation flows automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

**Docker is the recommended way to run COBOL Migration Agents.** It provides a self-contained environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

### 1. Install & Setup

```bash
# Automated setup
./scripts/docker-setup.sh setup

# Configure AI credentials (main configuration)
cp config/settings.env.example config/settings.local.env
nano config/settings.local.env

# Configure Docker-specific settings (optional)
nano .env
```

### 2. Run the Migration

```bash
./scripts/docker-setup.sh validate
./scripts/docker-setup.sh samples
./scripts/docker-setup.sh migrate
